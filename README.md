## the-way-we-move

Let's play with canvas drawing and WebAudio API, see if something interesting might appear.
A first attempt to _Code like no one's watching_.

### What is this?

The starting idea was the produce a _drawing_ that _move_/_evolve_ according its spectator's environment.
Something like a painting that lives with the person looking at it.
For now, it's still a simple experiment with HTML5 [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
I'm thinking about using more inputs in the future, such as the gyroscope, camera, geolocation, etc.

### Live demo

You can give it a try at https://the-way-we-move.surge.sh/

### What about the name

It's named after _The way we move_, a song and album by Langhorne Slim that I'm totally fond of at the moment.
